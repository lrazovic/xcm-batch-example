/**
 * Asset Transfer from Asset Hub to Parachain with Fee Payment in Asset.
 *
 * Scenario:
 * 1. A user wants to send an asset from Asset Hub to a Parachain.
 * 2. The user doesn't have DOT to pay the transaction fee.
 * 3. The user wants to pay the transaction fee with the asset they're sending.
 * 4. The asset can be swapped for DOT on Asset Hub to cover the fee.
